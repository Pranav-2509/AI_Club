# AI Club
This repo contains some of the code I have worked on as a part of my Project Member role in the AI Club, IIT Madras.

A brief overview of the contents of this repo :
1) "DC_Miniproj_Code" contains the code I worked on as a part of my Deputy Coordinator Mini Project, which was based on NLP. It is a Pytorch model which translates text from French to English and vice versa, although it replaces the accented characters of French with their closest English alphabet substitutes.

2) "Damped_Oscillator_PINN" and "NeuralODE" contain the code for a basic PINN and Neural Ordinary Differential Equation solver respectively. The code demonstration was performed by me in a workshop on PINNS and Neural ODEs.

3)  "U_Net", "Vision_Transformer_implementation" and "GAN" contain the code implementation of the respective models, which I did during the Literature Review of my AI Club Project member tenure.

4)  "Paper_Implementation_Retinex" contains the code I wrote for the model introduced in the following paper
